### Project Description: Redux-Chakra Todo List

This project is a simple to-do list application built with React, Redux, and Chakra UI. It demonstrates state management using `@reduxjs/toolkit` and provides a modern, responsive UI with Chakra UI components. Users can add and remove tasks dynamically, with state changes managed through Redux. The application structure includes a main `TodoList` component connected to the Redux store, showcasing efficient state handling and a clean design using elements like `Box`, `Button`, `Input`, and `List` from Chakra UI. This project serves as an excellent example of integrating Redux and Chakra UI in a React application.
